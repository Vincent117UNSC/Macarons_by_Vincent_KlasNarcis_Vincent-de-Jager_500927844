        <h2>What is a macaron?</h2>
        <img src="img/home_macarons_4.jpg" alt="image of macarons floating above a hand">
        <p>A macaron is a combination of two macaron shells (cookies) with a filling in between. The fillings can be whatever people like, from basics like vanilla and chocolate, to pistachio, Cheetos or even wasabi. <a href="what_is_a_macaron.html">Read more..</a></p>

        <h2>Where my passion for macarons came from.</h2>
        <img src="img/home_macarons_2.jpg" alt="lemon yellow and mocca brown macarons">
        <p>From being a little kid eating merengues at my grandparents, to making macarons. A story of how I went from childhood memories, to experimenting with egg whites and sugar, to making macarons that I can be proud of. <a href="my_passion.html">Read more..</a></p>

        <h2>How macarons are made & how I make macarons.</h2>
        <img src="img/home_macarons_3.jpg" alt="one blue and one black and pink macaron">
        <p>I also like to talk about all the steps it takes to make a delicious macaron, to get the perfect texture that makes a macaron so unique. Not a lot of ingredients are needed for a macaron, but the process can be quite challenging. I like to explain the different ways of macing macarons and how I do it myself. <a href="macaron_baking_process.html">Read more..</a></p>

        <h2>A bit more history of the macaron.</h2>
        <img src="img/home_macarons_1.jpg" alt="one yellow and one green and red macaron">
        <p>But where did the macaron come from, who came up with the idea, who found out if you mix ingredients this way you get a cookie with this kind of texture. Of course there is also much to tell about that. <a href="macaron_history.html">Read more..</a></p>
