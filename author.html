        <p>I am Vincent, in search of the purpose of life. I really like being creative and to build things. That is also why I choose to study communication and multimedia design, to be creative in the digital world. But also like to be creative with my hand, building things from architectural models to making macarons.</p>
        <p>I also like to game from time to time and recently started getting Lego again, rebuilding my childhood so to say. But one of my very favorite things to do would be traveling, seeing the world and go exploring.</p>
        <p>This was a little bit about myself, to get a glimpse of who I am, and who is behind those macarons and the website. Thanks to everybody taking their time to read and explore my website.</p>
