        <h2>The macaron</h2>
            <p>A macaron is a delicate and popular French pastry that consists of two almond meringue cookies sandwiched together with a filling. These cookies are typically round, smooth, and have a slightly crisp exterior while being soft and chewy on the inside. Macarons come in a variety of flavors and colors, with common flavors including chocolate, vanilla, raspberry, pistachio, and many more.</p>
            <p>The filling between the two macaron shells can be a ganache, buttercream, jam, or other flavored creams, depending on the desired taste and texture. Macarons are known for their vibrant colors and are often used for special occasions and as decorative elements in dessert displays.</p>
            <p>It's important to note that macarons should not be confused with macaroons, which are a different type of cookie made from shredded coconut and are typically denser and chewier. Macarons are a classic French pastry, while macaroons have their roots in various culinary traditions, including Jewish cuisine.</p>
